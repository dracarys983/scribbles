<p> 
Growing up is probably overrated. Or is it?
Everyone who is young wants to grow up until the day we feel we've grown up and lost the spirit of youth. And then, we want to feel young again. Its a maddening cycle.
And while we're at it, there are so many times when we completely get lost. We face existential crisis and we feel responsible for ourselves. Its a learning process.

<p>
However, what does "growing up" mean? It probably means "carpe diem" changes to "radical candor". "YOLO" changes to "discretionary responsibility". And to be honest, the world of grown ups is full of competition. There is so much pressure that self-reflection becomes extinct in our lives and we are influenced by the belief that success is everything. Chaos!

<p>
So, unless we are ready for "chaos", I suggest we hold on to "carpe diem" and "YOLO". Try not to grow up all at once.
