You go to the west, embrace their ideas, their culture and have some ravishing experiences. You go to the east, do similar things and make some memories there. But when you get back to the start, sometimes you start being pretentious about what is cool and what is not, what is right and what is not. Maybe you start judging people even when similar things might've happened with you when you were away from the start.

Being pretentious might win you admirers, but it never wins hearts.
